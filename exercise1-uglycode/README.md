# Exercise 1 - Ugly code

In this exercise you will be cleaning up and refactoring ugly, obfuscated code.

We are going to assume you have IntelliJ Community Edition installed.

## 1. Dev environment

> **Before you begin**: Please make sure that you have the following installed:
- IntelliJ Community Edition: [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- Java dev kit: [Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)


* Open `pom.xml` in IntelliJ by selecting *Import project* from the Welcome Screen.

## 2. Assignment

- The code does some math-y things...
- Analyze and understand the code.
- Write tests that verify your presumptions (See the [All about testing code](https://github.com/nerdschoolbergen/all-about-testing-code) workshop exercises if you have forgotten how to write tests)
- Refactor the code ensure the tests are still passing.
